# Optimizing APIs with Intel CPUs and OneDNN

## Intel CPUs: High-Performance Processing
Intel CPUs are at the heart of modern computing and provide the processing power required for high-speed data operations and machine learning tasks. Key benefits for APIs include:

- **Concurrency**: Intel CPUs efficiently manage multiple tasks, making them ideal for concurrent API requests.
- **Optimization**: Features like Hyper-Threading and Turbo Boost optimize CPU usage, essential for demanding NLP workloads.

## OneDNN: Deep Learning Acceleration
OneDNN, part of the Intel oneAPI toolkit, provides deep learning optimizations that boost performance for APIs.
Key advantages include:
- **Speed**: OneDNN's optimized routines for deep learning primitives accelerate computations for faster API responses.
- **Efficiency**: It optimizes memory usage and computational steps, reducing resource requirements.

## Usage Of IntelOneAPI in our product:

We used hugginface/intel accelerated text-generation model intel/neural-chat for acheiving text-generation in our project and achieving better response time and accuracy

## Performance Comparision

The following graphs illustrate the substantial performance improvements achieved by integrating Intel¬Æ oneAPI libraries and frameworks into our models:

1. comparing execution time between normal gpt-3.5 text-generation model and intel/hugginface neural-chat model
